- **Character Movement:** Smooth and responsive controls for Pac-Man.
- **Ghost AI:** Intelligent ghost behavior that adds challenge to the game.
- **Collision Detection:** Accurate detection of collisions between Pac-Man, ghosts, and walls.
- **Game Mechanics:** Classic gameplay elements including power pellets and ghost vulnerability.
